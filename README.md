Personal site I made during my first year in univeristy. Right now its not very good and uses a bootstrap template, its purpose was for me to learn a bit about the process of buying a domain name and hosting my own site. It is live at http://ryanbiggs.co.uk/ for you to check out if you wish.

My intention by uploading this to github is for me to now work on updating it and showcasing some of my skills thats I have since learned since my first year of uni. 

Right now my current goal is to turn it into some form of blog using php inbetween working on other projects.
